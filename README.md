## Hi ðŸ‘‹





- ðŸ”­ I am a student majoring in Artificial Intelligence, currently dedicated to the research of machine learning algorithms.
- ðŸŒ± Meanwhile, I have a certain background in embedded development and am also interested in intelligent control algorithms implemented in C++.
- âš¡ I have also done some superficial research on theoretical physics and pay attention to the application of physics knowledge in machine learning. I won the first prize in the 2024 National College Students Physics Competition.My favorite physicist is Feynman.
